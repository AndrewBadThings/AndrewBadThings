* Hi, I'm Andrew. 
* I have lots of other names, but my main one for now is Andrew c:
* I'm practicing poetry, as of currently. 
* My main interests are bad things, block tales and grace for now. 
* c*h always welcome and extremely encouraged, every time someone cudds i get really happy, really 
* byf, I guess?
* * im on antidepressants, and accidentally overdose at times on painkillers, which leads to me passing out suddenly or just feeling REALLY bad. if I go randomly afk and don't come back, that could be the reason, but it mostly happens when I'm off.
  * I can accidentally trigger you as well, please take everythong I say with a grain of salt, every mean thing I say is not intentional or meant to be a joke. 
* I hallucinate. If I act weird, saying I see something etc, it's likely that I'm not joking. It's not funny, dont joke about this if it happens whole I'm int w you please.
